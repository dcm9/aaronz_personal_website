=====

* Exploiting Idiosyncratic Habits in No-Limit Hold'em
  * Data mined 10 million+ poker hand histories from IRC dataset to analyze idiosyncratic strategies in multi-agent asymmetric poker 
  * Designed robust variables that modeled behavior by reducing dimensions of player actions into axes of tightness and aggressiveness
  * Clustered player strategies through K-means and Gaussian Mixture models to predict playersâ€™ systematically exploitable strategies

* Analyzing Election Outcomes through Policy Sentiments
  * Constructed Multiple Linear Regression model to predict election preference based on survey answers with 65% accuracy; optimized regression predictions by tuning LASSO regularization with cross-validation that improved model RSS by 25%
