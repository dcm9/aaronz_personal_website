Welcome to my personal website!

Hi there! I'm Aaron Zhang, a University of Chicago student in the class of 2025 studying Economics and Data Science. I'm particularly passionate about professionally pursuing a career in finance and technology, and I enjoy playing poker, cooking, and reading about aviation in my free time. I'm really happy that you've decided to visit!
